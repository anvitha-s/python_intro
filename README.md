# python_intro
Introductory material to python for an audience with no coding experience and little to no computational experience.

## Start Jupyter
Install Anaconda and Jupyter notebook 
- Windows
  - In the Start menu, select Anaconda3 (64-bit) => Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda3)

- Mac
  - Open a Terminal (type “terminal” in Spotlight (the magnifying glass)).  In the terminal, type:
    - `jupyter notebook`


- Linux
  - Open a Terminal and, in the Terminal, type:
    - `jupyter notebook`

A web browser should open, displaying a list of files and directories in your home folder, as shown below.

If the web browser does not open automatically, copy/paste one of the URLs starting with “http:” shown in the terminal or command window into a web browser.  The web browser should display a list of files and directories in your home folder.
